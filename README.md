# Edge of the Woods

https://modrinth.com/modpack/edge-of-the-woods/

This modpack is a personal little project of mine; I wanted to bring together a clean selection of magic mods, I wanted to write a questbook, and I wanted to work with the Neoforge architecture for the first time.

You are a magical apprentice who has been sent to the magical world as part of your work-study program. Whether with friends or alone, it's your job to study the six schools of magic and graduate to being a master mage. To help you on this journey, a questbook has been provided for you by your professor. Study it well, take your time, and most importantly: Have fun.

## What is the recommended server host for Edge of the Woods?

I do not recommend server hosts at all. The official server for EotW is hosted on a small computer on the edge of my desk that I picked up out of a dumpster. Remember that the best server host is YOU. No privately-owned company can compare to the stability and convenience of your own computer.

## Non-Modrinth Sources
EotW features Ars Nouveau, which is hosted on Modrinth, but pulled from Curseforge for version reasons.

EotW features Ars Scalae, which is hosted on Curseforge.

Both of these mods are being sourced here in the event that I am required by license to do so.
